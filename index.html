<h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>A second generation language also known as "2GL" is a grouping of programming languages associated with assembly
        languages. Unlike the first generation languages, programs can be written symbolically, using English words
        (also known as mnemonics), in a way that a human can understand and are subsequently converted into machine
        language by an assembler.</p>
