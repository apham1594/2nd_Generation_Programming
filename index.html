<h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>A second generation language also known as "2GL" is a grouping of programming languages associated with assembly
        languages. Unlike the first generation languages, programs can be written symbolically, using English words
        (also known as mnemonics), in a way that a human can understand and are subsequently converted into machine
        language by an assembler.</p>

    <h2> Advantages of second generation language </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> It is easy to develop understand and modify the program developed in these languages are compared to those developed in the first generation programming language.</li>
        <li> The programs written in these languages are less prone to errors and therefore can be maintained with a great case.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> What is it good for? </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Assemblers allow for easier debugging of the program, and also introduce more advanced programming mechanisms such as macro Programming and structured Programming.
            </li>
        <li> 2GL are mostly used for the implementation of low-level kernels and drivers and for performance-oriented and processing-intensive applications such as computer games, graphic manipulation applications and video editing applications.</li>
    </ol>
